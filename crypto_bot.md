I found a trading bot better than Photon x.com/0xMentor_/status/1919708879489007749

Insiders gave me access - now I print 20–30 SOL daily

PumpFun traders won’t like this

Becoming a millionaire overnight through memecoin trading is possible, but only if you have the best tools at your disposal.

In my experience, Photon and BullX struggle with delays and bugs during peak trading periods.

That's why some well-connected friends recommended the swiftest bot, which offers real-time data refresh rates.

1/ Let's jump into a brief assessment of a trading platform.

I believe it's the top choice for trading memecoins.

I'm referring to http://axiom.trade/@mentor - loaded with numerous advantages:

Affordable fees (more economical than rivals), exclusive RPC nodes, Twitter sniping, and additional features.

2/ Trending Tokens & Dex Monitor

Utilize this feature to monitor trending tokens instantly.

Experience rapid-story evolutions, international memecoins, and new releases from prominent personalities - all in one place.

Filter by duration, explore various protocols, and purchase tokens on the spot.

3/ Pulse tracker / small cap watcher

there's also a tool that monitors all fresh tokens and those beginning their transition phase.

I often monitor "final stretch" and "migrated" tokens.

filters can be used to zoom in on early potential winners.

4/ Monitor movers and shakers

Receive instant alerts for insider wallets, tracking their purchases as they happen.

Additionally, activate notifications for their Twitter updates - making it easy to pounce on new token announcements and initiate immediate buys (or automate your purchases).

5/ Rapid futures trading

Hyperliquid enables swift futures transactions, perfect for seizing opportunities during immediate news releases or announcements.

I frequently rely on this capability, and it's impressively quick.

6/ Embrace savvy trading principles

Avoid putting your entire deposit on the line - limit investments to 5% of your total funds for each trade.

Focus on well-established meme coins that boast a robust online presence and significant market capitalizations.

Ultimately, your decisions are in your hands - trade astutely and craft your own approaches.

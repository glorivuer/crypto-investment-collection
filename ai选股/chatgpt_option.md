第一天，砰！我的钱翻倍的速度比克里斯·詹纳签下新的真人秀合同还快。

到了第四天，我感觉兴奋极了，决定把收益分成两笔交易。然后我突然有了一个天才（或者说愚蠢）的想法：让 ChatGPT 和 Grok 来一场终极人工智能对决，看看谁才是真正能让我不假思索就能赚钱的领头羊。

我给这两个人工智能机器人提供了一大堆枯燥的数据，然后说：“嘿，筛选一下这些乱七八糟的数据，找出一些能把我的啤酒和烧烤预算变成卡戴珊级别现金的交易。”

然后我甚至想到，我可以手动输入（数据的）截图并上传电子表格，确保它们只使用最优质的数据。

快进10个交易日（两周）：我做了18笔交易，平仓了17笔，不知何故，这两个AI兄弟的胜率都堪称完美，高达100%。

ChatGPT 已经完成了13笔，Grok 完成了5笔，而且它们都没有让我失望！

我迫不及待地想看看YOLO AI在接下来的六个月里能走多远。敬请期待；是时候再来一杯了——这将是一次疯狂的旅程！

A Reddit user deposited $400 into Robinhood, then let ChatGPT pick option trades. 100% win reate over 10 days.

He uploads spreadsheets and screenshots with detailed fundamentals, options chains, technical indicators, and macro data, then tells each model to filter that information and propose trades that fit strict probability-of-profit and risk limits. 

They still place and close orders manually but plan to keep the head-to-head test running for 6 months.

This is his prompt

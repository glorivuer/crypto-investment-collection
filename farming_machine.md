If you’re farming GRASS — you know the grind.

Manual logins, dashboards, check-ins, proxies.

It takes time, consistency, and patience.

With GPT-4.1, we can automate 90% of it — even across dozens of accounts.

Let me show you how in 5 prompts:

Prompt 1: Account Rotation

“Write a Python script that logs into multiple GRASS accounts via Selenium using rotating proxies. The script should open Chrome, log in, capture points, and store results in a CSV.”


Prompt 2: Proxy Health Checker

“Add a proxy checker to the script. If a proxy fails or times out, switch to the next one in the list automatically.”


Prompt 3: Daily Automation

“Schedule the script to run every 24 hours using Task Scheduler (Windows) or crontab (Linux). Make sure it logs timestamp, account email, proxy used, and GRASS points farmed.”

Prompt 4: Stealth & Anti-ban

“Add randomized delays, user-agent rotation, and headless browsing options to reduce the chance of detection while farming GRASS across multiple accounts.”


Prompt 5: Multi-Account Management

“Create a JSON config format to store login credentials, proxy data, and wallet info for each GRASS account. Script should read from config and loop through all accounts.”
